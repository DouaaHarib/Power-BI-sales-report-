This project's goal was to create paginated report. For a chocolate factory to track key performance indicators
production and sales performance, and to make strategic decisions in real time. We chose to use Power BI for its flexibility and ease of use, as well as for its many visualization functions of data.
As part of our project, we have implemented reports using the Power BI in order to follow the progress of its activities in a clear and precise way. We imported a dataset acquired from different environments and cleaned this data to ensure its integrity and quality. We also ran DAX queries to create measures in Power BI. Using Power BI features, such as charts, tables and dynamic filters, we have created a data visualization tool efficient and easy to use. 
This paginated report will facilitate the work for
decisionmakers, as it allows them to get access quickly and
easily to the information they need.
